  "description": "One of the most iconic images in the history of art, this woodblock print depicts an enormous wave threatening boats off the coast of Kanagawa. Mount Fuji is visible in the background, appearing small in comparison to the towering wave. The dramatic composition captures the raw power of nature and the vulnerability of humanity against natural forces.",
  "artistBio": "Katsushika Hokusai (1760-1849) was a Japanese ukiyo-e artist and printmaker of the Edo period. Best known for this print and the series 'Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji,' Hokusai's work had a profound influence on European art movements including Impressionism and Art Nouveau. He is considered one of the greatest artists in Japanese history.",
  "historicalContext": "Created during Japan's Edo period, this print is part of the series 'Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji.' The work was produced during a time when Japan was largely isolated from the West. After Japan opened to trade in the 1850s, Hokusai's prints flooded European markets and profoundly influenced Western artists, a phenomenon known as 'Japonisme.'",
  "technique": "The print was created using the traditional Japanese woodblock printing technique. Multiple blocks were carved and used with different colors - most notably the distinctive Prussian blue (Berlin blue) that had recently become available in Japan. The print required precise registration of multiple color blocks to achieve the final multi-colored image.",
  "location": "Multiple impressions exist in collections worldwide, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, British Museum, and Tokyo National Museum"
