His vedute, or cityscapes, were highly prized by British and European collectors, contributing to the popularity of the Grand Tour. Canaletto's work is characterized by its clarity, precision, and luminous depiction of light and water. He influenced generations of landscape and cityscape painters, both in Italy and abroad.",

The annual regatta was a major public event, showcasing the city's maritime traditions and attracting visitors from across Europe. Canaletto's painting documents not only the spectacle itself but also the architectural splendor and cosmopolitan spirit of Venice during the Rococo period.",

The painting demonstrates his technical virtuosity and his ability to balance topographical accuracy with lively narrative elements.",
