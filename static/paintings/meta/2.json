  "description": "A serene pastoral landscape capturing the gentle light of late afternoon as it bathes a meadow. Pissarro masterfully depicts the interplay of light and shadow across the grassy field, with his characteristic loose brushwork and vibrant color palette. The painting exemplifies the Impressionist focus on capturing fleeting moments in nature.",
  "artistBio": "Camille Pissarro (1830-1903) was a Danish-French Impressionist and Neo-Impressionist painter, often called the 'dean of the Impressionist painters.' He was a pivotal figure in both Impressionist and Post-Impressionist movements, known for his landscapes of rural and urban life.",
  "historicalContext": "Created during Pissarro's mature period, this work reflects his continued dedication to painting en plein air (outdoors) and his deep connection to the French countryside. By 1890, Pissarro had returned to pure Impressionism after his brief experimentation with Pointillism.",
  "technique": "Pissarro employed short, broken brushstrokes characteristic of Impressionism to capture the effects of natural light. His palette consists of soft greens, warm ochres, and subtle blues that create atmospheric depth and convey the peaceful ambiance of the late afternoon.",
